title: Walking and Photo Bingo
month: June
year: 2023
description: Time to go for a walk, take some pictures and maybe get a bingo or two. This is just a test text to see how it would look like with a longer text. Don't mind this. Just move along. Maybe I should just copy the text. This is just a test text to see how it would look like with a longer text. Don't mind this. Just move along. Maybe I should just copy the text.

    import Bingocard from './Bingocard.svelte';
	import { bingoSquares } from './squaresData.js';

For June, let's go with something a bit lighter. The only task on the list is to

And maybe update your friends on how it went, and share some pictures in ⁠〘📸〙lifesnaps.

@Olge created a great bingo card to help inspire you during your adventures! Take a photo when you find something on the card, and try to find one thing per walk.
